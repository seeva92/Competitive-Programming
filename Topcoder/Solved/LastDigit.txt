PROBLEM STATEMENT
Limak chose a positive integer X and wrote it on a blackboard.
After that, every day he erased the last digit of the current number.
He stopped when he erased all digits.


After the process was over, Limak computed the sum of all numbers that appeared on the blackboard, including the original number X.


For example, if the original number was 509, the numbers that appeared on the blackboard were the numbers 509, 50, and 5.
Their sum is 564.


You are given a long long S.
Limak wants you to find a number X such that the above process produces the sum S.
It can be shown that for any positive S there is at most one valid X.
If there is a valid X, find and return it.
Otherwise, return -1.

DEFINITION
Class:LastDigit
Method:findX
Parameters:long long
Returns:long long
Method signature:long long findX(long long S)


CONSTRAINTS
-S will be between 1 and 10^18, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
564

Returns: 509

This is the example from the problem statement. The value X = 509 produces the sum 564, as shown above.

1)
565

Returns: -1

There is no X for which the sum would be 565.

2)
3000

Returns: 2701

You can check that 2701 + 270 + 27 + 2 = 3000.

3)
137174210616796

Returns: 123456789555123



4)
837592744927492746

Returns: -1



5)
999999999999999999

Returns: 900000000000000000
