PROBLEM STATEMENT
Our garden contains a single row of flowers.
You are given the current contents of the row in the string garden.
Each character in garden represents one flower.
Different characters represent different colors.
Flowers of the same color all look the same.



You may rearrange the flowers in your garden into any order you like.
(Formally, you may swap any two flowers in your garden, and you can do so arbitrarily many times.)



You are also given a string forbid of the same length as garden.
You want to rearrange garden into a new string G that will satisfy the following conditions:

No two adjacent flowers will have the same color. Formally, for each valid i, G[i] and G[i+1] must differ.
For each valid i, G[i] must not be equal to forbid[i].


Let X be the number of different strings G that satisfy all conditions given above.
Compute and return the number (X modulo 1,000,000,007).
