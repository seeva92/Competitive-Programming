PROBLEM STATEMENT
Return the number of positive integers that are multiples of each number in divisors and divisors of each number in multiples.

DEFINITION
Class:FactoVisors
Method:getNum
Parameters:vector <int>, vector <int>
Returns:int
Method signature:int getNum(vector <int> divisors, vector <int> multiples)


CONSTRAINTS
-divisors and multiples will each contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of divisors and multiples will be between 1 and 10^9, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{1}
{100}

Returns: 9

The working integers are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, and 100.

1)
{6,9}
{18}

Returns: 1

18 is the only integer that works.

2)
{6,9}
{96,180}

Returns: 0

No integers work.

3)
{2,4}
{256}

Returns: 7



4)
{1000,10000,100000}
{1000000000}

Returns: 25

Beware of overflow.
