PROBLEM STATEMENT
Cucumber Boy is trying to be elected to the city council.
In order to achieve that, he needs to show that he has a lot of support in some part of the city.

The city is divided into N districts.
These are numbered from 0 to N-1.
For each i, there are A[i] voters in district i, and out of them B[i] support Cucumber Boy.

Cucumber Boy must choose a part of the city: K or more districts with consecutive numbers.
Cucumber Boy wants to maximize the proportion of votes in his favor.
Formally, Cucumber Boy wants to maximize the value X/Y, where Y is the total number of voters in the chosen districts and X is the number of Cucumber Boy's supporters among them.

You are given the tuple (integer)s A and B with N elements each.
You are also given the integer K.
Compute and return a real number: the largest value X/Y that can be achieved.

DEFINITION
Class:GerrymanderEasy
Method:getmax
Parameters:tuple (integer), tuple (integer), integer
Returns:float
Method signature:def getmax(self, A, B, K):


NOTES
-The returned value must have an absolute or relative error less than 1e-9.


CONSTRAINTS
-A will contain between 1 and 1,000 elements, inclusive.
-A and B will contain the same number of elements.
-For each i, A[i] will be between 1 and 10,000, inclusive.
-For each i, B[i] will be between 0 and A[i], inclusive.
-K will be between 1 and the number of elements in A, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{5,1,2,7}
{4,0,2,2}
2

Returns: 0.75

The optimal solution is to choose districts 0, 1, and 2.
The total number of voters will be Y = 5+1+2 = 8.
The total number of Cucumber Boy's supporters will be X = 4+0+2 = 6.
Hence, the proportion of votes in Cucumber Boy's favor is X/Y = 0.75.

Note that the chosen districts must have consecutive numbers.
We are not allowed to choose only districts 0 and 2.

1)
{12,34,56,78,90}
{1,1,1,1,1}
1

Returns: 0.08333333333333333



2)
{10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000,10000}
{3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3}
5

Returns: 5.4E-4



3)
{123,4,46,88,22,34,564,87,56,311,886}
{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}
1

Returns: 0.0

Sometimes the answer will be 0.
