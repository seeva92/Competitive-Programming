PROBLEM STATEMENT
A Ferrers diagram of the partition of positive number n = a1 + a2 + ... + ak, for a list a1, a2, ..., ak of k positive integers with a1 ≥ a2 ≥ ... ≥ ak is an arrangement of n boxes in k rows, such that the boxes are left-justified, the first row is of length a1, the second row is of length a2, and so on, with the kth row of length ak. Let's call a FIELD diagram of order fieldOrder a Ferrers diagram with a1 ≤ fieldOrder, a2 ≤ fieldOrder - 1, ..., ak ≤ fieldOrder - k + 1, so a FIELD diagram can have a number of rows which is less than or equal to fieldOrder. Your method will be given fieldOrder, it should return the total number of FIELD diagrams of order fieldOrder. 

DEFINITION

EXAMPLES

0)
2

Returns: 4

There are four possible FIELD diagrams for fieldOrder equal to 2, corresponding to partitions: (1), (2), (1, 1), (2,1). They are shown in the picture below. There white stands for unused space in a row and red for boxes, corresponding to FIELD diagrams. 



1)
3

Returns: 13

2)
5

Returns: 131
